# Professional ReadMe Template Generator ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)

## Description

I was (am?) sick of designing ReadMe files with structured markdown and proper information pertaining to my project. What to include, where to put what, how do I impress my fellow developers when they look at my code? Well, I decided it started with ReadMe's that were consistent and informative across all of my websites and applications. So I built this template maker, to ensure that my ReadMe files were professional looking, consistent, and encouraged other developers to reach out for collaboration!
